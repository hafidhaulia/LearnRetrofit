LearnRetrofit
===============

This application is an example of an application that implements [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/). The API
used is the TMDB API that displays a list now playing movies.

To use retrofit you need model and client (the interface)

In this sample app used two model because json response from tmdb api is json object so you need another object to connect it.
